The plugin gives you an accurate analytics board where you can know exactly how many abandoned carts you faced, how much were they worth, how many were you able to recover, and how much money did you win back.

**üìà Easily Build Up Your Mailing List While People Shop üìà**
A special feature of the plugin is the Add To Cart Popup Modal. When a guest visitor clicks on the Add To Cart button, a persuasive pop-up will appear and ask for the email address. A great way grow your mailing list and increase abandoned cart recovery rate.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is an abandoned cart? =
When a buyer adds products to the cart, then leaves the site without completing the purchase, either from the cart page or from the checkout, it is considered as an abandoned cart.
= Can I run more than 2 email campaigns? =
In the Free plugin, you can only run 2 email campaigns at once.

For more campaigns, you have to use the Pro plugin.
= Does the plugin track abandoned carts? =
You can enable the option to track abandoned carts automatically.

Go to Dashboard > Cart Lift and click on the Settings tab.

There you will find an option to Enable Abandon Cart Tracking.

Once you enable it, the plugin will start keeping track and records of all abandoned carts on your store.
= Will it work if I don't use WooCommerce Or EDD? =
The plugin is specialized for WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads. So you have to be using one of the two to be able to use this plugin.
= Can I integrate it with other marketing automation tools? =
The plugin has the option to integrate with external marketing automation tools via webhook.
= How to add an unsubscribe link to the email?
When creating the email, you will find custom variables (on the right side of the text format panel).

From there, you can add the unsubscribe variable, which will work as the unsubscribe link for people to opt-out of the abandoned cart email campaign(s).
= Why aren't emails being sent out? =
First of all, make sure you have at least one email campaign activated.
Second, make sure you have WP Cron enabled for your site.

If these two are set, then your emails will be sent at the set intervals when you set up an abandoned cart email campaign.
=  How do I upgrade to pro? =
To upgrade to PRO, you may purchase a license key from:
Dashboard > Cart Lift > Go Pro
